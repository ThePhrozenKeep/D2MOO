# Note :
# Tests in static libraries might not get registered, see https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/faq.md#why-are-my-tests-in-a-static-library-not-getting-registered
# For this reason, and because it is interesting to have individual
# test executables for each library, it is suggested not to put tests directly in the libraries (even though doctest advocates this usage)
# Creating multiple executables is of course not mandatory, and one could use the same executable with various command lines to filter what tests to run.
