# D2MOO - Diablo II Method and Ordinal Overhaul

![Cow](doc/assets/img/ECWLHTH.gif)

This project is a re-implementation of the Diablo2 game coupled with patching facilities for modders.
The aim is to provide the modding community with an easy tool to understand and patch the game.
To ensure that we stay as close as possible to the original game, we do not provide fixes for bugs (yet).

The game assets, main executable code and anything related to hacking or piracy is NOT endorsed by the authors, and as such we will not provide code related to such subjects.
The original game assets and binaries is required to use this project.

## How to build

### Dependencies

For the patching we rely on the [D2.Detours](https://github.com/Lectem/D2.Detours.git) project, which is included as a git submodule. (use the `git submodule update --init` command, or clone this project with `git clone --recursive`)
You will also need to install the [CMake](https://cmake.org) build system and Visual C++ (or any C++ compiler that can generate .DLLs on Windows) which are freely available.

### Build the project

The recommended way is to use CMake presets.
You can generate a VS solution (located in `out/build/VS20XX`) and build using the command-line:

```sh
# Configure the CMake project
cmake --preset VS2019
# Build the release config (Optional. You may do it from Visual Studio itself)
cmake --build --preset VS2019 --config Release
# Install (Optional. Most people will want to debug instead of install)
cmake --build --preset VS2019 --config Release --target install
```

Or using the CMake-gui:

Where of course you can replace `VS2019` by `VS2022` if you are using Visual Studio 2022.

Read more in the [Advanced build and run](./doc/AdvancedBuildAndRun.md) documentation.

## Usage

If you are using a default Diablo2 install and generated `.sln` through *CMake*, you are good to go, simply build and run with `F5`!

Otherwise have a look at the [Advanced build and run](./doc/AdvancedBuildAndRun.md) and [Debugging](./doc/Debugging.md) documentation.

## Documentation

An embryo of documentation is available in the repository's [doc](./doc/) folder.

## D2MOO Debugger (Experimental!)

Start the game with the `-debug` argument.
For example: `D2.DetoursLauncher -- -debug`.  
Alternatively, you may set the environment variable `D2_DEBUGGER=1`.

## Versions

The project is currently based on the 1.10f version of the game.
Feel free to submit patches for other versions of the game!

## FAQ

### Why is the code so ugly and with names such as `a1`, `a2`, ... ?

The code was originally extracted using a reverse engineering tool, and slowly cleaned to use more understandable names.

### Can I build D2Common.dll and replace it directly with the one from the game ?

Yes this is now possible! However it is not guaranteed to be bugfree, so you may want to patch the functions you use instead.
We are in the (slow) process of checking each ordinal (exported functions) and patching them one by one. See [D2Common.patch.cpp](D2.Detours.patches/1.10f/D2Common.patch.cpp) for the current status of each ordinal.

This is **NOT** the case yet for other .dlls.

### Can I replace the game .dll files directly with the ones from D2MOO ?

NO !
As mentioned in the previous question, it only works with D2Common.dll (and is not bugfree).

### Why are some DLLs missing ?

Reversing the game is very time consuming. Since `D2Common.dll` and `D2Game.dll` contain most of the game logic, this is where the focus has been set. Any contribution and help is welcome !

### How can I write my own mod using this ?

The documentation for that is not written yet, please contact us directly on the Phrozen Keep [forums](https://www.d2mods.info) / [Discord server](https://discord.gg/NvfftHY).
More importantly, we need your [feedback](https://github.com/ThePhrozenKeep/D2MOO/issues/20) to determine a roadmap.

### Why yet another project for D2 modding and code editing ?

We felt that the current projects are not good enough, and more importantly did not cover enough parts of the game.
Having a centralized code that one can launch and use as reference will make it easier, we hope, for the modding community.

### I can not set breakpoints in Visual Studio

Please have a look at [Microsoft Child Process Debugging Power Tool](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsdbgplat.MicrosoftChildProcessDebuggingPowerTool).

### I have other questions !
